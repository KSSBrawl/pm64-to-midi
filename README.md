# pm64-to-midi
 Tool to convert music data from Paper Mario to MIDI

# Dependencies
 This script depends on the Mido Python library (https://github.com/mido/mido)

# How to obtain BGM files
 The expected BGM format is raw BGM data files that can be obtained with the Paper Mario decompilation project (https://github.com/pmret/papermario)\
 To get the BGM files, set up that repository per the instructions provided there, and then you can find the BGM files in assets/(version)/bgm
